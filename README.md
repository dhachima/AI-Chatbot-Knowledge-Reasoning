# AI-Chatbot-Knowledge-Reasoning
#  AI Chatbot with Knowledge-Based Reasoning

This project implements an **AI-based chatbot** that uses **forward chaining** for knowledge-based reasoning.  
It demonstrates how expert systems can infer conclusions logically from user-provided facts.  
The system is simple, explainable, and aligns with Artificial Intelligence laboratory objectives.

---

## Features
- Rule-based **Knowledge Representation**
- **Forward Chaining** Inference Engine
- Logical and Explainable Output
- Implemented in **Python 3.11.8**
- Easy to extend with new rules or reasoning methods

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Python  
- **IDE:** Microsoft Visual Studio / Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `re` — for text handling  
  - `tkinter` *(optional)* — for GUI extension  

---

##  How to Run
1. **Clone or download** this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/AI-Chatbot-Knowledge-Reasoning.git
   cd AI-Chatbot-Knowledge-Reasoning
🧮 Results

The chatbot successfully analyzes user inputs and provides results based on predefined rules.
It applies forward chaining to infer possible conditions and demonstrates logical reasoning and decision-making.

Input (Symptoms)	Inferred Condition(s)
fever, cough	flu
headache, nausea	migraine
tired, sad	stress
sore_throat, cough	cold
🔮 Future Enhancements

Add Backward Chaining for goal-driven reasoning

Integrate Naive Bayes for probabilistic inference

Add GUI Interface using tkinter

Include NLP features for natural conversation

Expand knowledge base for more real-world use cases
